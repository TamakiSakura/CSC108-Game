# CSC108-Game
A Military Strategy Game, programmed using knowlege completly within limits of CSC108, University of Toronto's first year python course.

I programmed it while I just finished the course. So this code seems pretty naive now with some, unfortunately, bad programming practice. But still this is interesting for me as I saw how my past were when I grew up from someone who just finished the first year's CS, while I still maintain some interests in military strategies :)

Source code includes unicode format not readable using traditional editor such as Vim. This also means it can only be run in Python3+ even if you replace the `print("")` to `print ""`.It will also have trouble running on terminal if you don't set unicode support in terminal, but it's fine on IDLE3 (which was the recommended one in CSC108, they don't tell you that you should switch to vim/emcas untill CSC209) without any configuration.
